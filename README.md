# CRUDE Whitepaper
# Bitshares Naira "CRUDE.NGN" Making P2P Transactions Easier for Nigerians

CRUDE.NGN makes P2P transactions faster, trustless and more secure. It uses the full merchant and HTLC capabilties of 

bitshares to  achieve its goals of an easier entry into the cryptocurrency market for Nigeiran users. CRUDE.NGN was 

initially meant for personal use however due to changes in the conditions to create the token the owner has decided to 

make an ICO.  The owner is looking to create a new bitshares economy in his birth country Nigeria 

and introduce Nigerians slowly into the amazing features of bitshares through this token. As with all UIA the token is 

limited (Semi-Custodial), however the account owner has set up certain principal guides in order to avoid mismanagement 

and fraud.
