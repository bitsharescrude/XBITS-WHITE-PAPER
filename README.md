# Bitshares Naira "XBITS.NGN" Making P2P Transactions Easier for Nigerians

XBITS.NGN makes P2P transactions faster, trustless and more secure. It uses the full merchant and HTLC capabilties of 

bitshares to  achieve its goals of an easier entry into the cryptocurrency market for Nigeiran users. XBITS.NGN was 

initially meant for personal use however due to changes in the conditions to create the token the owner has decided to 

make an ICO.  The owner is looking to create a new bitshares economy in his birth country Nigeria 

and introduce Nigerians slowly into the amazing features of bitshares through this token. As with all UIA the token is 

limited (Semi-Custodial), however the account owner has set up certain principal guides in order to avoid mismanagement 

and fraud.

with an equivalent amount of XBITS.NGN (Minimum donation is 500BTS). If you wish to support this token send your BTS to 

vnc7 or xbit.vnc7 account. once the amount is reached the asset will be created immediately by vnc7 and issued to xbits.vnc7 for 

distribution, users who commit will be given back approximately 50% of their 

donations in BTS (the money is drained from the fee pool) as a form of buyback on the market, also the remaining vesting 

balance will also be given back to donors after the 90days vesting period has passed.
